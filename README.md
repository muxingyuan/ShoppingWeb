I got sick and weak last December and could not keep web developer exercises.  In this summer I kind of recovered and register for Seneca single course of Java and Ecommerce programming.  Not in full scale as the course name, but our lectures and labs are mainly around Servlet, jsp, Java Beans, connection to database and use all of them in achieving web apps.  The course started in September, one session each week, now I am only one week (final exam) to go.

I feel after the course, I can continue with my own practises, less tension yet more persistence.
